# CNP - LAB Files

This is the repository where all files of **Computer Networks Lab** are added. 
Each file is updated as lab classes goes on

## First Experiment

The first experiment consists of **Bit Stuffing**, **Byte Stuffing** and **Cyclic Redundancy Check**. 

## Second Experiment

The second experiment consists of Encryption & Decryption using **Substitution method** & **Transposition Method**

### Substitution Method

Each character is encrypted using **Qwerty layout** keyboard starting with Q

### Transposition Method

The whole set of words is encrypted using the keyword **`MEGABUCK`**

### Third Experiment

The third experiment consists of minimum spanning tree(MST). 
It has two algorithm's:
- **Kruskal's** Algorithm -> Time complexity = O(n^2 * logn)
- **Prim's** Algorithm -> Time complexity = O(n * logn)
It concludes that Prim's algorithm is better than Kruskal's algorithm in terms of time complexity.

### Fifth Experiment

It implements socket programming. 
It only works in Linux-based Terminal. Two terminals need to be opened in parallel to act as client and server.

### Eighth Experiment

It is the implementation of **RSA** Algorithm.
RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Algorithm is a public-key cryptography algorithm which means it works on two different keys: ***Public*** Key and ***Private Key***. The Public Key is used for **encryption** and is known to ***everyone***, while the Private Key is used for ***decryption*** and must be kept ***secret*** by the receiver.
